# My journey making a personal webpage with PURE JAVASCRIPT!

Yes, you heard it right: PURE JAVASCRIPT!
In the current JavaScript ecosystem, frameworks built on top of packages have become almost mandatory for web development nowadays.
We all know the fancy names:

-   React
-   Angular
-   Svelte
-   Vue

## Frameworks are still Javascript

Frameworks are just Javascript with pre-coded features.
Now, before you go and yell at me in the comments, I know that using a framework can help you develop faster, and some of its features can be a godsend when you know that building them from scratch would be time-consuming and much more complex to integrate. However, I also know the instant dread that comes with updating npm packages and praying that a simple package, which could have been just three lines of my own code, doesn‚Äôt implode and break everything.
Frameworks are AWESOME, but sometimes you're injecting a lot of bloat into your web app for no reason (this also applies to that fancy package that everyone recommends, and you end up with 300 extra mini-packages just to perform a simple string validation).

## My Github Page Journey

So, I decided to make a personal GitHub page because I really enjoy creating things, and a personal space would be the best place to showcase some of my creations in a more interactive way. The original idea was to use HTMX, a simple framework for making HTML requests within my own HTML files. However, this concept quickly changed when I glanced at the documentation and realized that the main idea of HTMX would work much better with a more complex application. A simple GET request for my actual "screens" on the webpage would be sufficient. So, instead of bringing a cannon to a sword fight, I decided to go with the simple and PURE JavaScript!

## Fundamentals are important

At the end of the day, knowing how to operate and create a webpage with simple and clean JavaScript can help you understand how all the frameworks you use today work under the hood. Of course, every single JavaScript framework has its own ideas and manages itself very differently, but you can grasp a lot of their core functionalities by trying to build something similar to them.

**NO! I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO CREATE A NEW JS FRAMEWORK!**

What I am saying is that the next time you create a personal project, something you know will be used for learning, try using pure JS. You will understand the fundamentals of the language and its weak points. Then, when you dive into the next JS framework, you'll be like: _"This is just X, but with Y syntax"_

**Do you agree? Let's discuss this more in the comments!**

### [META]

This is the first chapter of my bi-weekly series documenting my personal projects. Next, I want to discuss the Screen Management system I created for my GitHub page, inspired by some concepts from Android's lifecycle.**If you like the idea, keep an eye out‚ÄîI will link the next post once it's done.**

**Next Post:** [NOT READY YET]
